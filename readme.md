This two-task program simulates the process of completing an engineering ticket for a system in the credit-card rewards department of JPMorgan Chase & Co. These tasks will walk you through the process of collecting the relevant codebase, creating a branch to make your changes, writing code, testing that code, and submitting a pull request to publish your work. 

[x] Task 1: Modify an existing system
Get an existing system up and running by creating a new class (Java, Git OOP)

[x] Task 2: Unit testing
Write a test suite for the class added in the previous task (Java, JUnit, Unit Testing)
